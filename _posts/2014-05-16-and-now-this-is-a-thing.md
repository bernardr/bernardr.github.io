## “It’s easy if you try …”

I took a few moments to install and run [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) today. I’ve tried all types of static site generators. Even the Jekyll derivitives, like [Octopress](octopress.org) — which still looks super rad to me.

### Here’s what I think is cool thus far.

*   markdown support
*   supposedly inline images (see the bottom)
*   fast builds (in a moment I’ll run `jekyll build` and **boom**. Done. Now that’s _awesome_.)

> “I showed this to my man here… What’d you think?”

I think I’m into it.
