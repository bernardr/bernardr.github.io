title:  New MapBox Version of the ACA Map
---

Last year, when I lived in Utah, [I slapped together a Google Map of ACA Locations](http://bernardr.com/unknown/affordable-care-act/). Back when I was working on it, I lamented my use of Google Maps. The licensing seemed too restricive for my purpose — to openly share what I felt was public information.

To it’s credit, Google Maps is incredibly easy to use. Provided you’ve already GeoCoded your data, it’s as easy as uploading a `.csv`.

As it turns out, using [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com) and [OpenSteetMap](http://openstreetmap.com) turned out to be just as easy.

## Mapbox Implementation

Honestly, there wasn’t much to this. Mapbox provides some gorgeous, tweakable tiles out of box, and provided me with the embed below.

Design-wise, I opted to go slightly modify one of their stock themes, but in the future I might make the time to develop a custom theme.

For now, I’m happy with this rudimentary map.

If you’d like to add to the project, feel free to check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/bernardr/aca-mapping).
