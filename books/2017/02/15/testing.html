Provided you’ve already GeoCoded your data, it’s as easy as uploading a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.csv</code>.</p><p>As it turns out, using <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> and <a href="http://openstreetmap.com">OpenSteetMap</a> turned out to be just as easy.</p><h2 id="mapbox-implementation">Mapbox Implementation</h2><p>Honestly, there wasn’t much to this. Mapbox provides some gorgeous, tweakable tiles out of box, and provided me with the embed below.</p><p>Design-wise, I opted to go slightly modify one of their stock themes, but in the future I might make the time to develop a custom theme.</p><p>For now, I’m happy with this rudimentary map.</p><p>If you’d like to add to the project, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/bernardr/aca-mapping">Github repo</a>.</p><iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" src="http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/bernardr.g805ncc9/attribution,zoompan,zoomwheel,geocoder,share.html"></iframe><footer><div class="links"> <a href="/blog/about/">About</a> <a href="/blog/contact/">Contact</a> <a href="/blog/hacks/">hacks</a></div><div class="theme" onclick="theme()" style=" background-image: url(/blog/images/theme.svg)"></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
